# JavaScript module pattern

## Before the workshop starts

* Read the code in `src/` to see how it works.

* Read the code in `exemplar/` to see what the final result of the workshop will be

## Starter (15 minutes)

* Talk about the [high level goal for the week](README.md#high-level-goal-for-the-week).

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Ask the developers to explore the `interrobangSmiley` module, then source any questions they couldn't answer. Don't attempt to answer there questions yet, just record them on the board.

## Main (30 minutes)

* Ask the developers to work through each step of the challenge. Give **10 minutes** for each step.

* Once they have spent 10 minutes trying to solve the challenge independently, live code the solution for that challenge, using the following process:

1. Uncomment the relevant line in `app.js` and see the fail.
2. Write a basic test for the new module, based on the README requirements.
3. Use TDD to build the module, including extending the test to make sure text hasn't been hard coded.
4. Once the module is functional, refactor the code to integrate the module.
5. Check the changes worked in `app.js`.

* During the live coding, take time to answer relevant questions from the board

Repeat this process for each mini-challenge.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Ask the students to answer the [questions](README.md#questions) in the README.

* Ask the students to list the benefits and risks of using the module pattern.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

[No PLENARY.md because there's not really much material besides the things above.]
