# What does great process look like?

When observing your pair, keep in mind the following indicators of good process. If your pair does not follow these steps, then record the timestamp and make a note of what happened.

## TDD
- Starts with a test for the smallest meaningful feature
- Writing a test and watching it fail before writing code
- Only write code to fix the test fail message you can see
- Testing the behaviour of a function, not state of a class
- Including edge cases in tests
- Looking for an opportunity to refactor the code after getting to green
- Refactoring verbose tests after the code is working

## Programming Fluently
- Sets up a project with only the tools they require e.g. git and a test library for a small project
- Can setup a new project in their chosen language quickly, and knows where to look if they get stuck
- Refers to official documentation when stuck on how to use a tool or language, rather than copying and pasting from old examples
- Knows how to use their tools e.g. git, text editor, test suite
- Organises their coding environment e.g. using split screens to see code and tests.

## Debugging
- Reads error messages before taking action
- Follows a debugging process e.g. tightens the loop and gets visibility
- Perseveres to solve the issue, even if they are not immediately aware of the cause
elated to the error they are seeing, and can quickly identify useful resources
- Has a range to debugging approaches they can deploy to resolve an issue
- Strives to build a mental model of the code they are working on e.g. diagramming or explaining what the code does in plain english

## Modelling
- Takes time to break the problem down into smaller problems
- Writes out the individual parts of the problem in plain english before turning these into code
- Has a clear picture of how the user will interact with the application
- Does just enough design upfront to start
- Does not think about adopting a specific solution until a pattern emerges in the code
- Focuses on understanding the problem without thinking about how they will solve it

## Refactoring
- Using names that clearly relate to the class/method's purpose
- Waiting until there is a pattern in the code before refactoring
- Checking code regularly for opportunities to refactor
- Retaining and improving readability when refactoring
- Making small changes to improve the quality of the code
- Continually makes small improvements to the code

## Problem Solving
- Tries to understand the problem by diagramming, or writing pseudo-code
- Breaks the problem down into smaller problems
- Has a problem solving approach that they default to e.g. defining inputs and outputs, or drawing a user interaction diagram
- Verbalises their thought process when solving a problem
- Uses Google to supplement their problem solving approach e.g. looking up specific syntax
- Waits until they know what to do before writing code
- Can change their approach when faced with a tricky problem e.g. switching from diagramming to writing pseudo-code
- Waits until they have a clear problem definition and good first test before writing code
