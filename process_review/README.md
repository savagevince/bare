# Process Review
_Get better at programming fluently_

What skills and behaviours does a great dev have? Have a look [here](./observation_guidance.md) to read through them. While not exhaustive, if you are able to exhibit these to a high standard, you should be confident of your skills.

So, you ask, how do I get better?

Practice.

## Process Workshops

#### What are they?
A coach will facilitate a session where you and up to 15 others from any cohort will pair up and get close feedback on your approach to programming.

#### What will happen?
You’ll pair up and spend 30 mins observing your partner record their screen and TDD an exercise, while you use a rubric to note down what and how they do in order to give them useful feedback.

And then you switch - you’ll record your screen and TDD an exercise for 30 mins while your partner observes to give feedback

Here are the possible programs to build - you'll find the details of them in the exercises repo above. Complete them in the following order:

1. Middle letter
2. Scrabble solve
3. Checkout
4. Echo
5. Bank

#### Who should do this?

Anyone at any stage of their learning here at Makers. You could do it during week 1 or week 7 or week 15 or any week you are here.

The objective is simply to practice and get feedback to improve your approach to programming.

#### Why should I do this?
For a number of reasons.

Practicing writing code while under observation helps show you how good your current process is - where do you get stuck, how are you debugging, how's your approach to TDD - and therefore an accelerated way to improve.

Usefully you'll get feedback from your pair, and a recording to re-watch yourself write code.

It's great feedback and confidence-boosting to show yourself you're getting better at programming.

#### What do I need to bring?

It's helpful to bring the following
- pen and paper for any planning you do
- a timer for when you're observing someone write code.
- a set of process cards.

## Individual

You don't need to attend a process workshop to benefit from this. Recording your own screen while you write some code is a useful tool to help you improve your development process.

To make it the most useful, follow these steps:

1. Reflect on your process - decide what part of your process you want to focus on.
2. Find a small exercise, or kata to practice it. (Start really small and simple and then extend from there)
3. Set a timer for 30 mins.
4. Record your screen
5. Program.
6. Review your recorded process, and use rubric to note down where to improve.
7. Repeat.

Feel free to reach out to a coach during coaching hours to sit with you and give you feedback. (They'll watch it 3x-5x times the speed)
