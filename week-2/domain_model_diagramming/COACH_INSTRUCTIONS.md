# Domain model diagramming

## Learning objectives

See [README](./README.md).

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Elicit an understanding of the term 'domain' and 'domain model'.

> It can help to list domains they've met so far (Airport, London Tube system, Santander Cycles). They might get confused between technical domains (e.g. RSpec is a framework) and functional domains (e.g. RSpec is a DSL for testing). A good definition is something like 'a domain model depicts the structure of a system and the information flowing through it'.

* Show the two kinds of modelling (boxes and arrows, and sequence diagrams) they could use.

> Elicit domains from the Oystercard project.

* Do thumbs on the learning objectives.

## Main (50 minutes)

* Ask the students to read the README.  (Even better to send it out before the workshop so you can potentially save time in the workshop.)

* Set the students going on implementing the coin flipping program.

* Tell the students when 25 minutes is up and set them off for another 25 minutes on the notebook user stories.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

- 1 minute, write your free thoughts on modelling so far. What was good, what was bad?

> Do this in silence. This is so they get into the plenary headspace and have something to iterate on.

- Draw out the TDD cycle, including the feature and unit test stages (BDD cycle) (5 minutes, discussion 5 minutes)

> Use the timer to give an elected member of each group 30 seconds to detail their group's diagram. Capture the iterated explanations in your own diagram. A good meta-point for you to make is that this iterative, fast process builds a better shared model than giving one person 5 minutes to explain their model.

- Insert the diagramming process into the TDD cycle. (5 minutes, discussion 5 minutes)

> Again, use the timer. This time give 40 seconds. Reflect the discussion in your master copy. The idea here is to reflect the fact that a program model needs frequent updating at specific points.

- Return to the 1-minute summary earlier. Factor it to include the new insights from the plenary.

> Students should come away from this session with an artefact that they can use as a metacognitive crutch for doing TDD with diagramming. It should help them to navigate the dichotomy of diagramming vs. feeling your way using TDD.
