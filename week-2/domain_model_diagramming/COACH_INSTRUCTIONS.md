# Domain model diagramming

## Learning objectives

See [README](./README.md).

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Do thumbs on the learning objectives.

* Ask the students to read the README.  (Even better to send it out before the workshop so you can potentially save time in the workshop.)

* Do a very quick Q&A.

* Do thumbs on the learning objectives.

## Main (50 minutes)

* Set the students going on implementing the coin flipping program.

* Tell the students when 25 minutes is up and set them off for another 25 minutes on the notebook user stories.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

- 1 minute, write your free thoughts on modelling so far. What was good, what was bad?

- Draw out the TDD cycle, including the feature and unit test stages (BDD cycle) (5 minutes, discussion 5 minutes)

> Use the timer to give an elected member of each group 30 seconds to detail their group's diagram. Capture the iterated explanations in your own diagram.

- Insert the diagramming process into the TDD cycle. (5 minutes, discussion 5 minutes)

> Again, use the timer. This time give 40 seconds. Reflect the discussion in your master copy. The idea here is to reflect the fact that a program model needs frequent updating at specific points.

- Return to the 1-minute summary earlier. Factor it to include the new insights from the plenary.

> Students should come away from this session with an artefact that they can use as a metacognitive crutch for doing TDD with diagramming. It should help them to navigate the dichotomy of diagramming vs. feeling your way using TDD.
