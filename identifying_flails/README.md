# Identifying Coding Flails

The goal of this workshop is to be able to spot deviations from good coding process, either when observing your pair partner code or when watching a screen recording of your own process.

## Option 1

1) Watch a video on your own and try to spot the flails

2) Gather the spotted flails from the group

3) Watch the video as a group and pause it every time there is a flail to discuss what is happening, and why it might be happening

4) Share a different video for them to watch independently, spotting the flails

5) Share the list of flails and see how well they did identifying them

## Option 2

1) Gather ideas for the group for identifying good coding process

2) For each of these, identify what flailing would look like

3) Pair up and watch each other code for 15 minutes each, trying to spot flails. Or, watch a video in pairs trying to spot flails
